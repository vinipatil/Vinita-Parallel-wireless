                <p class="p2">HetNet Gateway (HNG)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">HNG is designed to combine the benefits of gateway VNFs with real-time SON and centralized
                    scheduling in one intelligent solution to reduce complexity and costs of deploying multi-vendor,
                    multi-technology HetNets. HNG is the industry’s first carrier-grade, NFV/SDN-based, 3GPP compliant
                    RAN orchestrator that unifies any technology and any vendor RAN to present it as one common
                    interface to the core. HNG logically sits between the RAN and core and abstracts the RAN on any COTS
                    hardware while making RAN self-configuring, self-optimizing, and self-healing; this also enables HNG
                    to reduce signaling/paging load on the core.</p>

                <p class="p3">Backhaul is considered to be in the top three challenges in deploying RAN. With the
                    traditional approach, bringing backhaul to a site takes a long time and requires a substantial
                    upfront investment because in order to deliver the highest speed possible, Service Providers need
                    very expensive backhaul fiber. Backhaul technology requirements should focus firstly on the
                    flexibility of using different types of backhaul – whatever is available at the potential deployment
                    site, secondly, be easily configurable for mass deployments of small cells, and thirdly, be
                    resilient to any type of failures. These three requirements of backhaul flexibility, automation and
                    resilience were taken into consideration when Parallel Wireless developed their backhaul solution.

                    The first community to be connected through trials of the new micro network technology is the small
                    village of Sebergham, in Cumbria. Sebergham has 129 dwellings and 347 residents, and sits in a deep

                <p class="p3">The various solutions employed by today’s operators require additional support for
                    signaling and paging optimization. HetNet Gateway does not require additional support as it not only
                    aggregates eNodeBs under its management (along with their corresponding S1 interfaces), but also
                    offers optimized paging. As a result, MME does not have to reach to individual cells for paging and
                    only has to send paging to HNG. HNG would internally employ different techniques to determine the
                    equivalent subset of cell(s) the UE should be paged with. With these advantages, a Service Provider
                    can choose to build larger tracking areas without incurring signaling overload.</p>

        <p class="p2">Rural Micro Network Technology</p>
        <p class="p3">In the past, the main barrier to offering mobile coverage in remote areas of the UK has been the
            cost of building large radio towers and laying fiber/cables across the countryside. This new micro network
            first connects a small station (CWS nodes from Parallel Wireless) via mesh to a nearby macro tower (about
            6km), and then extends the coverage and capacity of the tower to the nodes in the valley via backhaul mesh
            capabilities. Each node in the valley provides access to the community and backhaul connection to
            neighboring nodes. HetNet Gateway helps with the node configuration, optimization, traffic mitigation, and
            enables additional level of resilience and improves the economics of connecting hard-to-reach areas via
            cost-effective mesh.</p>

            connect to each other and the packet core without the need for expensive fiber. The nodes can also daisy
