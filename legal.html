            subscribe to or order a product or service, register as a user, respond to an online survey, submit an
            application for employment, or otherwise actively send us data, we usually collect data such as your name,
            email address, mailing address, telephone number, and certain information related to you or the business you
            represent. In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information, phone number,
            and billing and shipping addresses. In connection with applications for employment, the Site will also
            prompt you to provide employment and educational history, phone number, and other contact information. We
            sometimes partner with other organizations. When we do, we may present you with the option to share your

            instance, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it. We are not
            responsible for emails you receive from a partner organization or third party that has independently
            obtained your email (i.e., when Parallel does not provide your email to the third party), even if the email
            is a third party email promoting Parallel’s goods or services.</p>

            your name and mailing address, may be exchanged with other organizations. Members may opt out of such
            membership list exchanges by following the opt-out procedures described below. If you submit an application
            for employment through our careers page hosted by a third party, your data will be provided directly to such
            third party provider and Parallel will also share your information with other organizations necessary to

            the bottom of any email sent to you by Parallel. You should know that opting out or unsubscribing from our
            site does not delete your personal information from our system, which may exist in backup or
            disaster-recovery files. Even if you opt out, we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or
            informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, renewal
            of your membership, updates regarding the status of your application for employment, contests you have
            entered or other transactions you have undertaken.</p>
        <p class="p11"><b>5. Security</b><br>Parallel uses industry accepted data collection and encryption
            methodologies in an attempt to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information.
            While we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data
            over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
        <p class="p11"><b>6. IP Addresses</b><br>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically
            assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number
            may be the same each time you access the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Parallel
            uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is
            logged on our server when your computer requests information from Parallel. Parallel reserves the right, in
            rare instances, to use IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="p11">Contract: For example, we may process personal information of business contacts to
                    establish a contract for goods or services between you and Parallel, maintain contact points, and
                    send you invoices for ordered goods or services.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="p11">Legal obligation: For example, when it is reasonably necessary for Parallel to retain
                    your personal data to comply with a legal obligation on Parallel, such as tax laws, export control
                    compliance, or to exercise or defend our legal rights.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="p11">Consent: We will rely on your consent to retain and use your personal data if no other
                    basis is relevant. You may have the right to object or withdraw your consent. Please review the
                    “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.</p>
            </li>

        <p class="p11"><b>Data Transfers</b><br>To provide our products and services, including employment services,
            Parallel may transfer data across Parallel’s affiliate companies in different geographic locations. When we
            transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., we do so in compliance with appropriate safeguards, such
            as signing E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
        <p class="p11"><b>Data Subject Rights</b><br>Your local law may provide you with rights regarding the
            distribution and use of your personal data. For example, GDPR gives residents of the EU rights that they can

            residents of the State of California have the right to request a list of all third parties to which a
            company conducting business in California has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for
            direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that
            gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing
            purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise this choice.
            <br>Parallel qualifies for this alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you
            with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third
